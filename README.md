# Fireworks Simulation - Just for Fun! üéÜ

Welcome to the **Fireworks Simulation** project! This is a simple and fun Python program that simulates a fireworks display using the `turtle` graphics library. It's designed to be visually entertaining and is perfect for experimenting with graphical effects in Python.

## How It Works üöÄ

The program creates a virtual fireworks show where colorful particles explode and fade out, mimicking real fireworks. Here's a quick breakdown of how it works:

- **Firework Launch**: Fireworks are launched from the bottom of the screen and shoot upwards.
- **Explosion**: When a firework reaches its peak, it explodes into a burst of colorful particles.
- **Particle Effects**: The particles spread out, change colors, and gradually fade away, creating a mesmerizing effect.
- **Interactive**: You can click anywhere on the screen to launch a new firework!

## Features ‚ú®

- **Rainbow Colors**: Each firework and its particles cycle through a spectrum of colors.
- **Gravity Simulation**: Gravity affects particles, making them fall naturally.
- **Customizable Settings**: Adjust parameters like particle size, explosion speed, and fade rate to create different effects.
- **Interactive Fun**: Click on the screen to create your fireworks display!

## Customization üé®

Feel free to tweak the code to create your unique effects! Here are some parameters you can adjust:

- **`PARTICLE_SIZE`**: Controls the size of the particles.
- **`EXPLOSION_SPEED`**: Determines how fast the particles spread out.
- **`FADE_RATE`**: Adjusts how quickly the particles fade.
- **`RAINBOW_SPEED`**: Changes how fast the colors cycle.
